                <p> <class="subtitle"> Yellow Cab has always been the trademark of NYC. It had been the primary mode of transportation for the residents for a very long time. While yellow cabs still exist, people get around the city differently today.

                    Since 2014, NYC has been transforming into one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the country. The city has built over 479 miles of bike lanes, including 180 miles of protected bike lanes, making bicycle rides safer and more convenient. Today, the NYC Department of Transportation estimates that approximately 800,000 New Yorkers ride a bike regularly, and over 530,000 cycling trips are made daily, more than triple the amount of that from 15 years ago. NYC Department of Transportation also reports that the bike commutes in NYC have grown by 26% since 2014, more than five times faster than the average growth of the peer cities such as San Francisco and Chicago. With an increasing popularity of the bike share system like Citi Bike, more New Yorkers are opting for commuting and getting around their neighborhoods with a bike.

                <h3>Citi Bike has become an integral part of NYC’s transportation network
                    </h3>
                <p>
                    Citi Bike is the country’s largest bike-share system, launched in May 2013. Today, it offers more than 25,000 bikes in over 1500 stations, and operates in partnership with the NYC Department of Transportation. According to Citi Bike’s monthly operating report from May 2022, the most popular stations are near large transit and tourist hubs. The report also notes that the ridership is generally higher during the weekdays: the average trip lasts 16 minutes and covers 1.3 miles, representing the commuters riding to work and the residents getting around their neighborhoods. The highest concentration of Citi Bike stations is in Brooklyn Heights, offering more than 2000 docks in the neighborhood alone.

                <h3> Cycling popularity has exploded since the Covid-19 pandemic
                    </h3>
                <p>
                    Even though almost all transportation systems in NYC, such as subway, taxis, trains, and buses, were disrupted at the height of the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, Citi Bike usage continued to grow. While the popularity of cycling is generally good news for the city, Citi Bike riders have been facing some frustrations with the lack of bikes and free ducks. Riders sometimes visit a few nearby stations before finding a bike or a dock to finish the trip. Even at the station near Central Park, which offers the highest capacity of bikes in NYC with 120 docks, it is almost impossible to find a single bike during the “rush hours” between 12:30 pm to 7:30 pm.

            <h3>Citi Bike will reach half of NYC’s residential population by 2024
                </h3>
                    <p>
                        After all, this is not bad news for Lyft, the company that owns Citi Bike. The company announced in 2018 that it would invest $100 million towards the massive expansion of Citi Bike by 2024. The expansion is currently happening in phases, and when completed, it will serve 70 square miles, reaching half of NYC’s residential population with over 40,000 bikes. The benefits of cycling in big cities are well documented globally, from reducing carbon footprint to improving mental health. The company reported that Citi Bike riders offset 2 million pounds of carbon and burned around 150 million calories  in a single month in 2022. Polly Trottenberg, the NYC Department of Transportation Commissioner said, “As a safe, sustainable, and affordable way to get around, cycling in New York City is growing faster than any other mode of travel. Riding a Citi Bike will be an even more convenient way to get to a vastly larger share of the city."

                    The number of yellow cabs was overtaken by the ride-hailing apps like Uber and Lyft already 5 years ago. While Uber has recently announced the partnership with Yellow Cab to save it from extinction, the popularity and expansion of Citi Bike may push down the demand for taxis all together. We may start to see more blues than yellows on the street of NYC in the not too distant future. And if and when that happens, it will be a good change for New Yorkers.
