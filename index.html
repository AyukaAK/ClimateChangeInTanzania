                    With increases in temperature and changes in rainfall patterns, the country must find a new way to farm the crops in the hotter future.

                    Ugali, the stiff porridge-like local cuisine made from maize flour, is loved and consumed daily in Tanzania. As a result, maize is the most important staple crop in the country. 
                    The USDA report estimates that maize provided up to 80% of dietary calorie intake for Tanzanian people in 2018. 
                    Almost all maize consumption is met by domestic production by smallholder farmers. 
                    Maize production is a significant source of income for the most, and they often rely on some of the yields to feed themselves. 
                </p>
                    <h3>Tanzania is getting hotter and drier with increasing global greenhouse gas emissions</h3>
                <p>
                    They have depended on reliable weather conditions for generations, planting maize during the wet winter months and harvesting them during the dry summer months. 
                    However, the weather pattern is changing. 
                    With ever-increasing global greenhouse gas emissions, the average temperature continues to rise, and the farmers face more prolonged dry spells. 
                    In Tanzania, the farmers highly depend on the weather conditions as only 3% of the total maize planted area is irrigated. 

                    While less rain is certainly not helpful for the farmers, the research conducted by Johanna Volk, a faculty of Agricultural Sciences at the University of Hohenheim shows that an increase in temperature is the main driver of future maize yield decline in Tanzania. 
                    Volk claims that the significant stress in maize production occurs when the temperature rises above 95 °F. 
                    This is bad news for the local farmers, as the number of days above 95F degrees is projected to increase with climate change. 
                    The World Bank estimates that the country will see about 9 to17 days with temperatures over 95F degrees per year by 2050, determined by how much we can reduce our CO2 emissions in the next decades.

                    <h3>Climate change alone affects maize yields to decline by 7.7% in the next decades</h3>
                <p>
                    The country is already seeing a climate change-induced decline in maize yields, and the problem is likely to get worse as atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gasses continue to rise. 
                    According to the study published by International Food Policy Research Institute, the country will face a more significant decline in crop yields compared to a scenario without changing climate. 
                    Maize production is significantly more affected by the future climate than other crops, and it is projected to decline by 7.7% by the year 2050.

                    The Tanzanian Government has been advocating for increased use of fertilizer and irrigation in the farmlands to tackle the declining crop yields, but Volk’s research shows these strategies will not significantly reduce the yield losses in the hotter future. 
                    Volk claims that climate adaptation measures, such as farming corn cultivars that perform well in higher temperatures, need to be explored. 
                </p>
                    <h3>Climate adaptation is likely the focus of the food security in Tanzania</h3>
                <p>
                    The United Nations claims that the number of people facing high levels of acute food insecurity is expected to increase dramatically in the rural areas of Tanzania in 2022, caused by more climate-induced dry spells, pests, and plant diseases. 
                    While climate change mitigation efforts such as net-zero by 2050 are crucial on a global level, there is an urgent need for increased focus on climate change adaptation measures in the food security space. 
                    In order to combat food security issues in Tanzania, it may be necessary for foreign aid to increase allocations for agricultural innovations.
